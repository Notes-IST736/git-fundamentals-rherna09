# What I learned
1. Markdown seems to be easier than R-Markdown
2. Github has profiles similar to social media profiles
3. Github has a dashboard where projects are visible
4. Repositories are projects. 

# What I'm still confused about
- I'm not sure about how branches and pulldowns.  How do they work?
- ow do you create a pulldown?  
- I'm not sure about how you post this markdown on the repository.
